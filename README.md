## Network Layer
Accomplished two IP algorithms (Link State and Distance Vector), designed the data structure of routing table stored in
each node, and wrote code on Dijkstraâ€™s and Bellman-Ford algorithms to find the shortest route.

## Transport Layer
Implemented TCP based on RFC793, achieved both passive and active opens, made actions to socket requests and incoming
packets, handled the timeout event with Go-Back-N mechanism, and improved transfer reliability with flow control.

## Application Layer
Built a HTTP client and two HTTP servers. The advanced server could handle multiple sockets simultaneously.
